<h1> API for Energens.</h1>

<p>
I will explain first, what is Energens. Energens, an engineering company, we deal with engineering services in general, installation of photovoltaic energy. We have a problem involving solar systems, which is to monitor several plants, to create a huge database, with records, depending on name, customer, system size, data forecasting part. So I decided to create an API to help in the process of automating functions and automatic calculations, created by the front-end, which will be developed later.
