# API for Energens.

I will explain first, what is Energens. Energens, an engineering company, works with engineering services in general, installing photovoltaic energy. We have a problem involving solar systems, which is monitoring several plants, creating a huge database, with records, depending on the name, customer, size of the system, part of the data forecast. So I decided to create an API to help in the process of automating functions and automatic calculations, created by the front-end, which will be developed later.
